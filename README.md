Windows8GameLab
===============

This repository holds the assets and the final solution for the Windows 8 Game with JavaScript hands on lab for the 
PGH.NET user group.

There are two directories in this repository:

Assets:  This directory contains all the assest for the lab (artwork and sound).  
Final:  This directory contains the final solution for comparison.  This solution was created in Windows 8 in Visual 
Studio 2012 Professional.  You must have both of these in order to open the solution and run the game.  If you don't have the correct
setup, you can still browse the source code with any text editor.
